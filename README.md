# deep-learning-video-classification
This project applies Deep Learning for video and image classification using models like 3D CNNs, VGG16, and EfficientNetB2. It employs techniques such as Batch Normalization, SpatialDropout3D, and Global Average Pooling to enhance performance, reduce overfitting, and achieve accurate feature extraction and classification.
